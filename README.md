HTML/CSS Starter Project
=================

This is an example of the final code for the project that we will create during the workshop.


The Project Files
------------

### ← README.md

That's this file, where you can tell people what your cool website does and how you built it.

### ← index.html

That's where all of the HTML, i.e. the content, is located. 

### ← style.css

That's where we're going to be writing all of the CSS for the page, i.e. the styling (presentational customizations) are located.

### ← assets

That's where you would save assets for your website.

We won't be using that folder in this project but you could easily use this for assets instead of the unsplash image that we added to the project. You can drag in `assets`, like images or music, to add them to your project.

### Other Folders

### Finished Project
See the [finished project](https://glitch.com/~html-css-workshop). (It may not be exactly the same as the page you worked on today, as we are always changing the workshop!)
